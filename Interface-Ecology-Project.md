# Getting Started with the Course Project

* Choose a piece of software from your daily life.
  * For now focus on software that has some kind of clear user interface, either graphical or physical.
  * Work together to list the various objects of interfacing that the software provides, also consider what kinds of interaction the software requires of the user. How is the software streamlined for efficiency in specific tasks?
  * Split up the tasks however you like: for example, one could focus on isolating and replicating the GUI elements (e.g. via digging through resource directories or deconstructing screenshots)
  * while the other researches a potential "ideal user" for the interface and the genealogical aspects of its elements.

## Then..
* try to replicate this interface (or parts of it) in Qt, using the built-in widgets, stylesheets, and the resources you created in the first exercise.
